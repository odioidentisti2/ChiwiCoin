# ChiwiCoin
A minimalistic decentralized blockchain
(inspired by https://github.com/dvf)

It can be deployed on a local machine, subnet or the web and it can be interacted with by the browser.

<br>

Visit:

http://localhost:5000/  -> to get the blockchain

http://localhost:5000/transaction  -> to create a new transaction

http://localhost:5000/mine  ->  to mine a new block

http://localhost:5000/register  -> to add your node (IP) to the network

http://localhost:5000/sync  -> to get to consensus by (eventually) updating that node


Replace "localhost" with the actual IP address in case of remote interaction: e.g., "192.168.1.2" from a subnet or the external IP address from the web (you probably must forward port 5000 in your router).
